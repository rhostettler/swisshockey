NL Live Scores TODO
===================

General
-------
* Package and upload to openrepos
* Make a webpage (toazter.ch or just github)?
* Error handling on timeout
* Implement functionality for NLB (should really be straight-forward once all
  NLA stuff is implemented)
* Catch app close-event and only put to background, keeping updates "alive"
  (configurable)?
* I could implement a roster function too but I'm not sure if I want that or
  not.
* Implement game-details
  => Implement the overall info as listview header instead so that the flow is
     ok
  => Implement encoding (fix the broken)
  => Add penalty names
  => Add symbols for events?
* Implement a callback action for notifications
