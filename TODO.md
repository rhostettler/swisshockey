NL Live Scores TODO
===================

General
-------
* Package and upload to openrepos
* Make a webpage (toazter.ch)
* Error handling on timeout?
* Smart updating when no gameday
* Catch app close-event and only put to background, keeping updates "alive"
  (configurable)
* Implement game-details => MouseArea in the delegate, slots and signals should 
  be easily handable
* Fix bug regarding game state update (need to set the changed flag and do 
  some filtering)

Notifications
-------------
* Include the scorer in the notifications
* Make notifications to fetch the complete game at once, not only the different
  fields
* Implement a callback action
